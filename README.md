## Project Title - üöóüí° Electric Vehicle Sales Dashboard üìä‚ö°

This repository presents an extensive analysis of Electric Vehicle Sales data, offering profound insights and facilitating strategic decision-making within the EV market.

### üìÉ Description

The Electric Vehicle Sales Dashboard provides a detailed examination of EV adoption and market trends. Featuring visualizations of total vehicles, average electric range, sales by city and make, BEV vs. PHEV share, sales by model year, and clean alternative fuel vehicle eligibility, this dashboard offers valuable insights into the burgeoning EV landscape. With filters for City, Electric Utility, and Electric Vehicle Types, the dashboard enables a nuanced analysis of trends and areas for growth, facilitating data-driven decision-making for manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers alike.


### üöÄ Project Goal

The aim of this project is to provide an in-depth evaluation of Electric Vehicle sales, facilitating a clearer understanding of market performance, adoption trends, and areas for growth.

### Project Motivation

This project is driven by the desire to convert raw EV sales data into actionable intelligence, fostering advancements in electric vehicle adoption and supporting the transition to sustainable transportation.

### ‚è≥ Dataset

The Electric Vehicle Sales data is presented in a dashboard format, derived from underlying datasets that include information on vehicle type, make, model, sales figures, and eligibility for clean alternative fuel vehicle (CAFV) incentives.

### üìë Dataset Description

The dashboard visualizes various aspects of EV sales, including:

* **Total Vehicles:** Overall number of electric vehicles.
* **Avg Electric Range:** Average range of electric vehicles.
* **Total Vehicles by Model Year:** Sales trends over different model years.
* **Total Vehicles by City and Make:** Distribution of sales across cities and by vehicle manufacturer.
* **BEV PHEV Vehicle Share:** Percentage breakdown of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).
* **Total Vehicles by Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility:** Categorization of vehicles based on their eligibility for CAFV incentives.
* **Total Vehicles by Model:** Sales breakdown by specific vehicle models.

### Requirement

* **To analyze** the geographical distribution by mapping EV density by ZIP code, county, and state.
* **To evaluate** market trends based on registered EV makes and models by separating battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).
* **Show** year-over-year trends of EV adoption through time-series graphs.
* **Develop an** interactive dashboard which enables to select data filters about location and vehicle types for recommending which areas need more charging facilities.

### üöÄ My Project

Comprehensive analysis has been conducted on the dataset, illustrated through a variety of engaging plots and charts. The dashboard provides an interactive experience, allowing users to filter data by City, Electric Utility, and Electric Vehicle Types for enhanced data exploration.
